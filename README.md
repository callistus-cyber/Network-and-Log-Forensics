Network and Log Forensics Investigation: Identifying the presence of unathorized user

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world cybersecurity investigation within a Security Operations Center (SOC). The objective is to analyze network activity and logs to identify a rogue user within the company, "Boring Office," suspected of impersonating an employee and disseminating sensitive information. This project showcases the critical thinking, technical skills, and forensic methodologies used to resolve cybersecurity incidents and reinforces the importance of log analysis and network traffic investigation in modern cybersecurity operations.

### Project Goal
By completing this project, I aimed to achieve the following:

- Analyze Network Traffic:
   - Investigate a provided .pcap file to extract key network activity details, including identifying a specific user's IP address.
- Leverage DHCP Logs:
   - Use DHCP logs to correlate the identified IP address to a specific host device within the network.
- Investigate Security Logs:
    - Review account security logs to determine which user account was actively logged in to the identified host device, uncovering the rogue user's identity.

### Skills Used
This project was designed to strengthen several critical cybersecurity skills, including:

- Packet Analysis Skills:
  - Gain proficiency in using tools like Wireshark to analyze .pcap files and extract meaningful information, such as IP addresses and suspicious activity patterns.
- Log Correlation Techniques:
  - Develop the ability to cross-reference DHCP logs with network traffic to map an IP address to a specific physical or virtual host within an environment.
- User Attribution through Security Logs:
  - Understand how to analyze account security logs to identify user actions and attribute activity to a specific individual.
- Incident Investigation Workflow:
  - Experience the structured approach of a Blue Team investigation, including evidence collection, analysis, and identification of the responsible user.

## Step 1:  Find the IP Address

1. Initial Packet Count:
 - After opening the .pcap file, observe the total packet count (e.g., 60 packets). This represents all captured network traffic.
2. Applying the First Filter:
 - Input the filter smtp in the "Apply a display filter..." field and press Enter.
 - This filter narrows down the results to packets using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is used for email communication.

3. Interpreting the Results:
 - The displayed packets will now only include SMTP traffic. This step is crucial for focusing the analysis on email-related activities within the network.
4. Refining the Filter Further:
 - To specifically locate packets containing a "FROM" field, which indicates the sender’s email address, refine the filter by inputting: (smtp contains "FROM")
 - This further reduces the displayed packets to those containing the keyword "FROM" within the SMTP protocol, allowing you to hone in on messages that may be tied to the rogue user.

 5. Analyze the Single Packet:
 - Observe that a single packet remains in the filtered results.
 - Check the info column to confirm that the packet is associated with the compromised user’s email account.
6. Identify the Source IP Address:
 - Locate the source IP address in the packet details: 10.10.1.4
 - This IP address indicates the network location of the rogue user’s activity.

### Step 2: Correlate to the Host Computer
1. Open the DHCP Log File:
 - Review the log structure and focus on identifying events close to the critical time of 12:50 PM when the emails were sent.

2. Narrow the Timeframe:
 - Since the rogue user had to gain access before 12:50 PM, analyze events occurring just before that time, specifically around 12:11 PM.
3. Locate the Event at 12:11:27 PM:
 - Find the event that shows the assignment of the IP address 10.10.1.4 to a host device.
4. Identify the Host Device:
 - Confirm that the log entry at 12:11:27 PM assigns the IP address 10.10.1.4 to the host device USER2.
5. Next Steps:
 - With the host device identified (USER2), access the security log for that device to determine which employee was logged in at the time. This will reveal the rogue user.
This streamlined process allows you to efficiently trace the rogue activity to its source using DHCP and security logs.
Example below.

### Step 3: Analyze the Security Log
1. Open the Security Log File:
2. Review the Log Entries:
 - Note the structure of the logs, paying close attention to the logon/logoff sessions and the associated host computers and users.

3. Analyze USER1 Entries:
 - Observe that the first two log entries are for host computer USER1, with the corresponding user identified as Jane Doe.
4. Focus on USER2 Entries:
 - The last two log entries indicate logon/logoff sessions for host computer USER2.
 - Check the user field for these entries to identify the logged-in user.
5. Confirm the Rogue User:
 - The logs reveal that John Doe was logged into USER2 during the time the sensitive emails were sent.
 - Confirm that the duration of John’s session perfectly overlaps with the timeframe of the rogue activity.
6. Conclude the Investigation:
 - John Doe was logged into the host device (USER2) that was used to send the sensitive emails, confirming him as the rogue user.

   ### Conclusion

   By connecting the dots between the DHCP logs, security logs, and the timeline of events, we have successfully identified the individual responsible for the unauthorized activity.
